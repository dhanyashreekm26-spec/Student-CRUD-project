This is a basic Student CRUD web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project demonstrates core web development concepts by allowing users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete student records through a simple and user-friendly interface. It focuses on front-end functionality, responsive design, and dynamic data handling using JavaScript. This project was developed as a beginner-level practice to strengthen my understanding of web development fundamentals and project structure on GitHub.
